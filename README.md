Fuck this post block bullshit.

Find offending posts and comments (yes, comments can be reported also) on Facebook quickly and easily without manually sifting through thousands of entries in your activity history. Does intelligent word-matching against a wordlist of approximately 1,700 offending words used by Google and Facebook when reviewing content reported by users.

*Deletion is manual. Don't cry, this still saved you countless hours.*

## How to use

- A 1,700 word wordlist will be added to the output directory when the project is compiled. Edit it as you wish, but this is taken from the official facebook and google "offensive" wordlists used when reviewing spam/harrassing/offensive content.

- Download just your "coments" and "posts" data in JSON format from facebook ([direct link here](https://www.facebook.com/dyi/?x=Admq-NxiFMq_hoDa&tab=new_archive))

- Drag the wordlist and and your JSON files containing your posts/comments into the app.

- The log will return only posts that could risk getting post blocked if reported by those couple hating cunts that like to play dirty (you know who you are).

- Delete or edit them accordingly on fb.
